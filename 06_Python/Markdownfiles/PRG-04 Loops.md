# Loops
You can use loops when you want to run a block of code multiple times. For example, you might want to do an operation on every item in a (large) list, or you want to write an algorithm that follows the same set of instructions for multiple iterations.
# Excercise 1
- Create a new script.
- Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
- Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

## Code
```python
x = 0
while x <= 10: #while x is lower than or equal to 10, print value and add 1 more.:
    print (x)
    x += 1 #this is the same as x = x + 1
    
    
```
