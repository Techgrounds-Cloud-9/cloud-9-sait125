Identity and Access Management

## Key terminology
Authentication: Authentication is a process that verifies that someone or something is who they say they are.  


Authorization:  Authorization is a process where a server determines if someone or something has permission to use a resource or acces a file. 


MFA: **M**ulti-**f**actor **a**uthentication.

>An authentication method that requires the user to provide 2 or more verification factors to gain acces to a resrouce.  
1) Something the user has: any physical object, smartphone , usb
2) Something the user knows: certain knowledge only known for the user (passwd, PIN)
3) Something the user is: fingerprint, eye iris, voice, typing speed, face, etc.  
4) Somewhere the user is: Some connection a to specific network or using GPS to identify the locaiton.

Least privilege: A security practice that requires limiting privilges to the minimum necessary to perform the task. This will reduce the attack surface of an organization.
