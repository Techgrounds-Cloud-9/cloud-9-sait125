### Overcome challenges



## Exercise

Find two more historic ciphers besides the Caesar cipher.
- Morse code
- Steganography in art


Find two digital ciphers that are being used today.

- base64

Send a symmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel. They should be able to decrypt the message using a key you share with them. Try to think of a way to share this encryption key without revealing it to everyone. 





You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides Slack. Analyse the shortcomings of this method.
